import 'server-only';

/**
 * The server-side client for the API.
 *
 * **The browser never calls `apps/api`.** Server components read through
 * `apiFetch` and server actions write through it. One origin for the browser
 * means no CORS surface on the API and no service token in browser JavaScript.
 *
 * **A fresh token per call, never one cached in module scope.** Service tokens
 * live 120 seconds. A module-level token in a long-lived Node process is valid
 * for two minutes after a deploy and rejected for the rest of the day, which is
 * the hardest shape of bug to reproduce. Minting is one HMAC; it is not worth
 * caching.
 *
 * `import 'server-only'` is the enforcement: a client component that imported
 * this for its types would pull `jsonwebtoken` and `AUTH_SECRET` into the browser
 * bundle, and the build fails instead.
 *
 * Every response is parsed with its `@saas/shared` schema. A page renders
 * whatever it is handed, so an API that drifted would produce a blank region
 * rather than an error, and the failure would be blamed on CSS.
 *
 * **Anonymous calls carry the browser's address.** The API rate-limits sign-in
 * and sign-up per address, and every request it sees comes from this server;
 * without `x-forwarded-for` everybody in the world would share one budget.
 * Signed-in calls are limited per user and need nothing extra.
