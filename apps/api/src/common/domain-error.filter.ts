/**
 * `DomainError` to an HTTP status, in one place.
 *
 * The services throw typed codes rather than framework exceptions, so none of
 * them depends on Nest and each is tested with plain objects.
 *
 * The code-to-status table itself is **not** here. It is `HTTP_STATUS` in
 * `@saas/shared`, beside the codes, so a new code without a status does not
 * compile. What this file owns is the rest: which exceptions get mapped at all,
 * and what a response body looks like.
 *
 * Every response carries `code`, so a client never has to match on prose. The
 * first time somebody improves the wording, a client that matched on it breaks.

 *   `new UnauthorizedException('...').getResponse()` is
 *   `{"message":"...","error":"Unauthorized","statusCode":401}`.
