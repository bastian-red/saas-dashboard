/**
 * Rate-limit budgets, scoped explicitly.
 *
 * `@nestjs/throttler` v6 applies EVERY named throttler to EVERY route unless a
 * route skips it, and by default keys each counter per route handler. Measured
 * against `ThrottlerGuard.canActivate` in 6.5.0: the loop runs all throttlers in
 * the list, and only `@SkipThrottle({ name: true })` or a `skipIf` stops one.
 * So a strict `auth` budget registered next to the general one, and then merely
 * "selected" with `@Throttle({ auth: {} })` on two routes, in fact limits every
 * route to the auth number. A sibling project shipped exactly that.
 *
 * Here each special budget has a `skipIf` that reads the route's `@Budget()`
 * metadata, so it applies to the routes that ask for it and to nothing else.
 *
 * **What a counter is keyed by.** Signed-in calls all arrive from the web
 * server, so the address is the same for every author; keying them by address
 * would make one busy author throttle everybody. They are keyed by the user id
 * in the verified token instead, which is why `SessionGuard` runs BEFORE the
 * throttler (`app.module.ts`). Anonymous calls (sign-in, sign-up) are keyed by
 * address: the web app forwards the browser's address in
 * `x-forwarded-for` and `trust proxy` is one hop. Counters are per budget, not
 * per route, so splitting a flood across two routes buys nothing.
