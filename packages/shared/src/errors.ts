 *   another tenant from one that does not; "403 here, 404 there" is a directory
 *   listing across tenants.
 * - `GONE` (410) is an invite that existed and has expired or been used. The
 *   invitee is told the truth, because the invite was real.
 * - `UNPROCESSABLE` (422) is a well-formed request the domain refuses on its
 *   merits: an accent colour that fails contrast, a downgrade below the seats in
 *   use. 400 would say "fix the
 *   shape of your request", which is not the problem.
